# Deno Rust cache proof results

Run date: 2026-07-27

Proof run: [GitHub Actions run 30309154588](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30309154588)

Pinned pair: `0c965f5e` -> `c3ea533f` (one Rust file and one TypeScript file changed)

Product cohort: BoringCache CLI `v1.14.0` and `boringcache/one@f0fb9b2d926a32b10c543e92093ba00c5a291b79`

## Decision result

| Strategy | Restore/setup | Build | End-to-end | Seed storage | Rust cache result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GitHub Actions Cargo + `target/` archives | 65s | 1,747s | 1,812s | 2.77 GiB | n/a |
| BoringCache Cargo registry + remote sccache | 16s | 2,253s | 2,269s | 2.07 GiB | 2,957 hits / 59 misses (98%) |

BoringCache stored 749,640,398 fewer bytes, a 25.2% reduction, but was 457
seconds (25.2%) slower on the rolling restore-plus-build path. This result does
not support replacing Deno's release `target/` archive with sccache alone.

The useful technical result is the combination of a 98% Rust cache hit rate
and a slower overall build. Deno's release surface is dominated after
compilation by ThinLTO, linking, and snapshot work. Restoring `target/` retains
that state; compiler-object caching does not.

## Release hybrid follow-up

Run date: 2026-07-28

Proof run: [GitHub Actions run 30333408848](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30333408848)

Benchmark commit: `4a364a9edfb799e214c6bc4f03baaeaaff6265fb`

This follow-up added a run-scoped archive of
`target/release/lto-cache` to the BoringCache Cargo + sccache lane. Both
rolling jobs ran on fresh hosted runners.

| Strategy | Restore/setup | Build | End-to-end | Seed storage | Rust cache result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GitHub Actions Cargo + `target/` archives | 83s | 1,470s | 1,553s | 2.77 GiB | n/a |
| BoringCache Cargo + sccache + ThinLTO archive | 15s | 2,018s | 2,033s | 2.20 GiB | 2,957 hits / 59 misses (98.04%) |

BoringCache stored 607,739,750 fewer bytes, a 20.5% reduction, but was 480
seconds (30.9%) slower end to end. This is not a migration win.

The ThinLTO entry was healthy and small: 739.84 MB logical data compressed to
141.85 MB, saved in 5.5 seconds, and restored in 8.0 seconds. The rolling build
verified the directory was non-empty before compiling. BoringCache telemetry
reported zero backend errors, and sccache reads averaged 3 ms.

Preserving this narrow linker cache therefore does not recover the advantage
of the full target archive. The remaining gap is in Cargo fingerprints,
build-script and proc-macro outputs, already-linked artifacts, final binaries,
and other build-graph state elsewhere under `target/`.

## Linux debug follow-up

Run date: 2026-07-28

Proof run: [GitHub Actions run 30333410651](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30333410651)

Benchmark commit: `4a364a9edfb799e214c6bc4f03baaeaaff6265fb`

The debug proof used the same pinned pair and product cohort as the release
proof. Both rolling jobs ran on fresh hosted runners.

| Strategy | Restore/setup | Build | End-to-end | Seed storage | Rust cache result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| GitHub Actions Cargo + `target/` archives | 45s | 356s | 401s | 1.71 GiB | n/a |
| BoringCache Cargo registry + remote sccache | 12s | 1,017s | 1,029s | 1.19 GiB | 1,538 hits / 54 misses (96.6%) |

BoringCache stored 556,443,808 fewer bytes, a 30.3% reduction, but was 628
seconds (156.6%) slower end to end. This is not a migration win.

The compiler cache itself was hot across Rust, C/C++, and assembler requests,
and service-side telemetry reported zero backend errors. The restore-only
sccache process reported five cache errors and 54 rejected writes for the 54
misses, as expected for a fail-closed read-only rolling lane. Those misses do
not explain the 10-minute gap.

The important result is that Deno's Linux debug command still inherits its
sysroot linker-plugin ThinLTO flags and performs local link, snapshot, and
build-graph work. The Actions lane restores all of `target/`; the sccache lane
does not restore that state. A high compiler-request hit rate therefore does
not translate into a faster complete Deno build on this surface either.

## Full-target plus sccache migration control

Run date: 2026-07-28

Proof runs:

- [Release run 30339284716](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30339284716)
- [Debug run 30339284781](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30339284781)

Benchmark commit: `a3c9118ca6f0bc166c5efbe2f6c0bb02a211b376`

These controls did not repeat either cold build. Each promotion job restored
the exact run-scoped Actions Cargo and full-target archives from the completed
proof, published their actual contents to BoringCache, and recorded zero build
seconds. The rolling job then restored those archives plus the source proof's
sccache tag on a fresh runner and applied Deno's mtime action.

| Profile | Strategy | Restore/setup | Build | End-to-end | Stored data | Rust cache result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Release | Actions Cargo + `target/` | 83s | 1,470s | 1,553s | 2.77 GiB | n/a |
| Release | BoringCache same paths + sccache | 54s | 1,809s | 1,863s | 4.24 GiB | 907 hits / 16 misses (98.27%) |
| Debug | Actions Cargo + `target/` | 45s | 356s | 401s | 1.71 GiB | n/a |
| Debug | BoringCache same paths + sccache | 39s | 502s | 541s | 2.51 GiB | 477 hits / 7 misses (98.55%) |

The BoringCache release control was 310 seconds (20.0%) slower; the debug
control was 140 seconds (34.9%) slower. Neither supports migration.

Target restoration itself worked and was faster. The release target archive
restored 2.28 GiB in 42.5 seconds; all archive setup completed 29 seconds
faster than Actions. Debug restored its 1.42 GiB target archive in 30 seconds;
all archive setup completed six seconds faster. Service telemetry reported
zero backend errors for both runs. Local extraction was the only archive-side
watch item.

The BoringCache archive components alone also stored less: 2,605,418,417 bytes
for release, 12.2% below Actions, and 1,677,512,969 bytes for debug, 8.8% below
Actions. Adding the source sccache CAS raised total storage 53.4% and 46.3%,
respectively.

This no-cold control has one deliberate migration constraint: its promoted
target tree was originally built without `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, then consumed with
sccache enabled. The hundreds of compiler requests despite full-target reuse
are consistent with wrapper/fingerprint churn, although the available Cargo
output does not prove that cause. The result is valid for the first migrated
rolling build, but it is not a steady-state sample from a target tree seeded
under sccache.

## v1.15 target fidelity and transport isolation

Run date: 2026-07-29

Proof runs:

- [Full-target plus sccache run 30468773381](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30468773381)
- [Target-only identity run 30472536341](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30472536341)
- [Exact target-transport control 30484371972](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30484371972)
- [Full-build target-transport repeat 30487469725](https://github.com/boringcache/benchmark-deno/actions/runs/30487469725)

The exact control held the remote BoringCache sccache seed and Cargo state
constant, then varied only the `target/` transport: Actions/cache in one lane
and the BoringCache archive adapter in the other. It deliberately skipped the
expensive Deno build and compared the restored trees before Cargo could mutate
them.

The canonical seed, Actions-restored target, and BoringCache-restored target
had the same manifest digest. All 30,428 entries matched exactly: 27,304 files,
3,120 directories, and four symlinks. The comparison covered file contents,
mode, nanosecond mtime, symlink target, hard-link topology, and xattrs, with
zero missing or different entries.

| Target transport | Logical target | Archive | Target restore | Combined controlled cache path |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Actions/cache target + BoringCache sccache | 9.77 GB | 2.78 GB | about 49s | about 88s |
| BoringCache target + BoringCache sccache | 9.77 GB | 2.42 GB | 45.4s | about 60s |

The BoringCache target archive downloaded in 22.6 seconds and extracted in
21.7 seconds. Its adapter restore overlapped the identical 1.95 GB remote
sccache prewarm; the Actions lane restored the target first and then started
that same prewarm. This is correctness and transport evidence, not a Deno build
performance claim.

The earlier 118-second end-to-end deficit cannot be assigned to target archive
fidelity. The paired Actions build and the target-only BoringCache control each
compiled 11 crates, but their two native Cargo phases were 14m26s + 8m28s and
18m15s + 10m47s respectively. The second runner was uniformly about 27% slower
in both phases despite doing the same Cargo work. The sccache-enabled run
finished those phases in 15m55s + 9m14s, 230 seconds faster than the
BoringCache target-only run, even though wrapper fingerprints caused more
Cargo nodes to execute. Cross-run hosted-runner compute variance therefore
dominated the apparent two-minute product gap.

The full-build repeat reused the same canonical seed and ran both target
transports concurrently with the same BoringCache sccache tag. Both target
identity and post-build freshness gates passed. The result writer then rejected
the two new strategy labels, so the run is red because of a reporting-contract
bug after both builds completed; the completed step logs retain the timings and
native-tool evidence.

| Target transport | Restore/setup | Build | End-to-end | Cargo phases |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Actions/cache target + BoringCache sccache | 54s | 1,717s | 1,771s | 17m53s + 10m38s |
| BoringCache target + BoringCache sccache | 59s | 1,693s | 1,752s | 17m31s + 10m36s |

Both lanes emitted the same 11 Cargo `Compiling` rows. Their sccache evidence
was also identical: 24 requests, 12 executed Rust compilations, zero hits, 12
misses, and zero cache errors. With the exact target restored, unchanged work
was already Cargo-fresh; the remaining changed outputs were legitimate misses.
This sample therefore does not show a steady-state build benefit from adding
sccache to the full target, but it also shows no target/sccache incompatibility.

The 24-second build difference is only 1.4% and is not attributable to target
transport. Both workers ran in Azure `eastus2`, but the reporting failure
prevented the CPU-model guard from producing a comparison artifact, so the
19-second end-to-end difference is diagnostic rather than a product win.

This repeat did not build a newer Deno source. It reused the same pinned
`0c965f5e` -> `c3ea533f` pair as every release control above. Valid hosted
Actions rolling samples for that pair have nevertheless taken 22m59s, 24m30s,
and 29m07s before this repeat's 28m13s and 28m37s. The 22m59s result is the
fast end of the observed four-core runner range, not an upstream average or a
new source baseline.

Transport performance also varied by network path. In this repeat,
Actions/cache delivered its 2.78 GB archive at 276 MB/s and completed target
restore in about 33 seconds. BoringCache delivered 2.42 GB at 104 MB/s and
completed target restore in 45.3 seconds; extraction was about 22 seconds for
both. The earlier restore-only control had both downloads near 104 MB/s and
BoringCache was faster. Hosted network locality, not archive fidelity, is the
remaining transport variable.

Any future native-build performance claim must either use the same persistent
runner for both lanes or record and normalize runner throughput. Restored-tree
identity and transport timing should remain separate gates so native compute
variance cannot be misdiagnosed as a cache corruption or restore regression.

## Storage correction

The comparison artifact generated by this run records zero bytes for the
Actions seed because its branch predated the strict storage-measurement fix
already present on `main`.

The two saved entries remain visible through GitHub's cache API and total
2,969,113,947 bytes:

- target archive: 2,815,031,100 bytes
- Cargo archive: 154,082,847 bytes

The helper now performs client-side prefix matching, accepts either token name,
and fails the workflow rather than publishing a zero measurement. The exact
cache API rows for this run return the total above.

## Decision

All requested sccache shapes lost: release sccache alone, release sccache plus
the narrow ThinLTO archive, debug sccache alone, and the first-migration
full-target plus sccache controls. Deno is not a current sccache migration
prospect.

The remaining useful performance control needs no new cold build: restore the
existing no-wrapper target seed and the existing stable-sccache target seed on
the same four-core Linux worker, then run both rolling builds in both orders.
That crossover would isolate whether sccache helps the persistent-target shape
without hosted CPU or page-cache order effects. Do not make a Deno performance
claim until a hardware-controlled sample wins and repeats.
