# RunsOn comparison

The comparison uses the same pinned Deno source, build commands, Rust
toolchain, sccache version, and runner specifications for both providers.

| Case | RunsOn | BoringCache |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `target` | Magic Cache archive of Cargo dependencies and `target` | Cargo dependency archives and typed `target` archive, compiler cache disabled |
| `sccache-only` | Native sccache S3 backend; no archives | Native sccache WebDAV backend; no archives |
| `target-sccache` | Native sccache S3 plus the target case's archives | Native sccache WebDAV plus the target case's archives |

No workflow rewrites source or Rust sysroot timestamps. Each product supplies
its own freshness behavior. BoringCache's typed Cargo target archive can
restore timestamps for unchanged tracked repository sources; this does not
establish freshness for every external or generated input.

The target workflow builds the pinned base commit cold, then builds its
immediate successor on a fresh runner using the cold build's cache. There is
no intervening same-commit warm build. Both phases publish their cache state.
The other entry points retain their declared same-commit and rolling phases.

Deno uses one BoringCache Action step without a configured Cargo command. The
Action restores before the two explicit Cargo build steps and publishes once
in its post step. RunsOn restores once and saves one archive after both builds.
The completed-job report includes the BoringCache post step in cache-save and
total time, and retains GitHub's raw job timing data. The per-phase artifact is
captured before post steps; use the completed-job report for total durations.

Cache namespaces include the run ID, run attempt, and case. Compiler cache
directories are never archived. An archive hit means the archive was restored;
compiler hits and misses are reported separately from native sccache statistics.
A successful build alone does not establish useful compiler cache reuse.

RunsOn comparisons share `deno-runs-on-rolling11` with
`cancel-in-progress: false` and `queue: max`. This keeps one comparison active
and allows pending runs to wait. Dispatches of older workflow revisions retain
their older queue policy.

Runs before this change used workflow timestamp preparation. Older default-
branch sccache comparisons archived a local sccache directory while BoringCache
used a native remote backend. Treat those as separate experiments, not matched
product comparisons. Historical artifacts remain unchanged.
