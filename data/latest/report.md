### Rolling Historical

| Benchmark | Headline | actions/cache | BoringCache | Result | Storage Saved | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hugo | First Build | 2m 5s | 3m 19s | reseeded 3/3 | 7.68 GB (95.85%) | 3 paired samples; BC reseeded 3/3; BC cache import proxy_unreadable; Rolling Docker reseeds are first-build investigation samples, not steady-state parity. |
| Immich | First Build | 0m 12s | 3m 16s | reseeded 2/3 | 7.40 GB (76.55%) | 3 paired samples; BC reseeded 2/3; BC cache import proxy_unreadable; Rolling Docker reseeds are first-build investigation samples, not steady-state parity. |
| Mastodon | First Build | 5m 34s | 4m 56s | reseeded 3/3 | 9.39 GB (90.27%) | 3 paired samples; BC reseeded 3/3; Rolling Docker reseeds are first-build investigation samples, not steady-state parity. |
| PostHog | First Build | 12m 54s | 7m 9s | reseeded 3/3 | 4.01 GB (40.37%) | 3 paired samples; BC reseeded 3/3; Rolling Docker reseeds are first-build investigation samples, not steady-state parity. |
| OpenTelemetry Java | Cold | 1m 10s | 10m 45s | 818% slower | 1.31 GB (63.48%) | run total slower; 3 paired samples |
| Spring AI | Cold | 1m 39s | 3m 34s | 116% slower | 2.11 GB (66.7%) | run total slower; 3 paired samples |
| gRPC | Cold | 33m 13s | 15m 40s | 53% faster | 647.71 MB more (-199.24%) | run total faster; BC used more storage; 3 paired samples |
| Zed | Run Total | 22m 15s | 22m 3s | near tie | 10.79 GB (94.01%) | 3 paired samples |
| n8n | Cold | 2m 37s | 2m 48s | 7% slower | 6.69 GB (93.29%) | run total slower; 3 paired samples |

Result is signed and near-tie aware, so tiny no-op runs do not get flattened into misleading 0% rows.

Rows use the latest 3 same-commit AC/BC pairs when enough samples are available. Artifact classification is the source of truth: invalid fresh warm imports are withheld from parity claims, and rolling Docker reseeds or cache-import misses render as investigation-only.
