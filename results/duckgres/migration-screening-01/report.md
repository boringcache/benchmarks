Question: How do build and cache reuse time and measured storage compare for the same pinned workload?

Measured scope: Timed build entrypoint plus measured cache restore/setup; upstream dependency installation remains included when the entrypoint performs it; unmeasured post-job save is reported separately

Observations: 0/4 recorded; 0 failed; 4 missing.

Completion checks: missing or failed.

Publication: unreviewed.
