# n8n: cadence-rolling-seed-distroless

Question: How do build and cache reuse time and measured storage compare for the same pinned workload?

Measured scope: Selected workload build plus measured provider setup: Turbo excludes dependency installation; Docker includes image export and load and excludes prepared source setup. Output checks and unmeasured post-job work are reported separately

Observations: 2/2 recorded; 0 failed; 0 missing.

Completion checks: passed.

Publication: unreviewed.

| Phase | Provider | Successful observations | Median build and cache reuse (s) | Range | Storage median (bytes) | Storage observations |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Changed-source build | Actions Cache | 1 | 142 | 142–142 | unmeasured | 0 |
| Changed-source build | BoringCache | 1 | 85 | 85–85 | 581058531 | 1 |

Comparison checks:

- Rolling seed and changed-source sequence are unverified.
