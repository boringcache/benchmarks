# posthog: cadence-rolling-seed-layers

Question: How do build and cache reuse time and measured storage compare for the same pinned workload?

Measured scope: Timed Docker build including image export and load, plus measured provider setup; output inspection is outside the timed build; provider post-job work is reported separately

Observations: 2/2 recorded; 0 failed; 0 missing.

Completion checks: passed.

Publication: unreviewed.

| Phase | Provider | Successful observations | Median build and cache reuse (s) | Range | Storage median (bytes) | Storage observations |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Changed-source build | Actions Cache | 1 | 2088 | 2088–2088 | unmeasured | 0 |
| Changed-source build | BoringCache | 1 | 814 | 814–814 | 6243631290 | 1 |

Comparison checks:

- Rolling seed and changed-source sequence are unverified.
