# posthog: shared-combined-lifecycle-01

Question: How do build and cache reuse time and measured storage compare for the same pinned workload?

Measured scope: Timed Docker build including image export and load, plus measured provider setup; output inspection is outside the timed build; provider post-job work is reported separately

Observations: 0/4 recorded; 0 failed; 4 missing.

Completion checks: missing or failed.

Publication: unreviewed.

| Phase | Provider | Successful observations | Median build and cache reuse (s) | Range | Storage median (bytes) | Storage observations |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
