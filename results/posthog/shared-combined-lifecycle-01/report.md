# posthog: shared-combined-lifecycle-01

Question: How do build and cache reuse time and measured storage compare for the same pinned workload?

Measured scope: Timed Docker build including image export and load, plus measured provider setup; output inspection is outside the timed build; provider post-job work is reported separately

Status: 4 declared observations missing; 0 failed. Publication requires review.

Execution: unqualified; missing or failed job completion checks. Timings alone do not qualify the series.

Queue time, dependency setup outside the declared scope, and job duration are context. They are excluded from the comparison. No observations were excluded.

| Phase | Provider | Successful observations | Median build_and_reuse_seconds | Range | Storage median (bytes) | Storage observations |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |

Run 37204588491 failed completion checks:

- Workflow concluded failure
- BoringCache posthog cold: failure
- GitHub Actions posthog cold: failure

Each run record retains its source, runner environment, verification, provider storage source, and evidence links. Missing storage is unmeasured; it is not zero. Original Actions URLs remain subject to retention; durable evidence publication must be verified before publication review.
